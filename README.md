# boot_site_torrent

simple page to bootstrap a site from a torrent archive.

Deps are build from : 	https://github.com/Stuk/jszip.git and 	https://github.com/webtorrent/webtorrent.git

Next step will be to boot them from external site with hash checking (reduce bandwith a bit more).

Script is as basic as possible just for testing (do not use).

Only tested on chromium, no care for old browser (especially webcrypto requirement).
